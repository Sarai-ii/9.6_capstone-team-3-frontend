        <h5>Harrassment</h5>
        <p>
            Harassment is not allowed. Users engaging in this behavior may be warned, suspended, or permanently suspended as described in the general abuse procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
            When judging whether a specific incident constitutes harassment, our team will consider factors such as whether the behavior was repeated, whether it was repeated after the offender was asked to stop, whether the behavior was targeted at a specific person, whether that target could have easily avoided encountering the behavior, whether the behavior would be considered unacceptable according to normal community standards, etc. Additionally, making complaints that are both (a) repeated and (b) baseless, particularly those targeting a specific user, can be considered harassing behavior and may be deemed a violation of the ToS. 
        </p>
        <h5>Pictures and Images</h5>
        <p>
            Your profile picture and any picture you upload to the site should be appropriate for general audiences. They should not contain depictions of genital nudity or explicit sexual activity.
